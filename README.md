# CCD-Image-Analyzer-Code
This is a comprehensive collection of data analysis routines for loading, smoothing, and radially integrating CCD images with [Igor Pro](https://www.wavemetrics.com/products/igorpro/igorpro.htm), a data analysis application provided by [WaveMetrics](https://www.wavemetrics.com/index.html).

## *Running The Procedures*
In order to run these procedures I recommend saving the .ipf files in the "User Files Directory" of Igor so that the procedures can be accessed by any Igor experiment. The .ipf file has a control panel GUI which makes running the analysis routines easy. The GUI can be accessed either through the macros menu or simple by pressing Ctrl-2. Detailed instructions for using each piece of code can be found at the top of the .ipf file.

## **Description of Routines**
Detailed instructions for using each piece of code can be found at the top of the .ipf file. 

## **Code Use**
I ask that you please give credit by citing this repository if using or adapting this code for your own research. Also, If you compute the magnetic susceptibility of your sample with these procedures, then please cite my Phys. Rev. Lett. publication from which that analysis originated.

## **Credits**
These procedures were developed in the [group](http://hsiehlab.caltech.edu/) of Professor David Hsieh in the [Institute for Quantum Information and Matter](http://iqim.caltech.edu/) at the California Institute for Technology.
